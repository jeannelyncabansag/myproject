Guidance Information and Monitoring System for Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University-North La Union Campus

INTRODUCTION

Guidance Program has become an integral part of the overalleducational program. 
With the basic assumption that all students needdirection in their personal, educational, and career planning, it has becomethe instructional responsibility of the guidance counselor, administrator andstaff to provide the students the specific knowledge and skills required toaddress the needs ( Arevalo, 2009 ). 

An important aspect of the Guidance program is the recognition that some students require special assistance in dealing with developmental problems and immediate crisis. With the teacher and other staff who are indirect contact with the students require support that can best be supplied by the guidance program. 
Guidance program moreover is based on the belief that all students, including those with challenging needs have the right tobenefit from effective instruction to ensure optimal development.The Manual systems are things of the past.

It’s a quite tedious,time consuming, less efficient, more error prone and inaccurate in comparisonto computerized system. A manual-based system will see information
recorded and kept in different ways such as in files in paper form. While a computer based information system will see data stored on various computer programs including on databases, 
Word documents, Excel etc. Both types of information system are designed to help a business carry out its daily running and operations. In recent times, computer-based systems are generally considered to be more popular as more businesses are choosing to keep up with the developments in information technology.

The Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University-North La Union Campus,Guidance Office is currently using a manual operation in monitoring students’ activities and performance. To a large extent, the workload is very taxing to retrieve files, generating reports and track attendance and offense, and implements standards adhere from the student manual. Considering that these are the factors subjectively experienced by the guidance counselors, the researcher prompted to develop a system called DMMMSU-NLUC Guidance Information and Monitoring System for better quality services. 


OBJECTIVES

The general objective is to develop, design and implement a Guidance Information and Monitoring System in DMMMSU-North La Union Campus, Bacnotan La Union.

Specific Objectives:

The proposed project specifically aims the following:

a.) To develop a system that will give detailed information of the students such as basic information, educational background and parent’s information.

b.) To create a module that will track the student’s attendance such as absent and late.

c.) To create a module that will track student’s penalties.

d.) To test and evaluate the effectiveness of the project study in terms of implementation.

The system will give benefit to the university, especially guidance office because the system will provide a secure and an automated records keeping system for creating records. It will provide an up-to-date and accurate record of students and will resolve the possibility of losing the information because it has database. It will track students' offenses and attendance. The system will also offer easily retrieval of records and generates report such as student’s information, disciplinary action records and attendance monitoring sheet information. The system will give benefit to the faculty because it will give convenient in passing student attendance and it can easily track the student’s status regarding with their attendance. The system will give benefit to the students because it will provide sufficient information about the Guidance office such as their services and hierarchy and they’ll be aware of committing offense because they’ll receive a notification from the Guidance.
